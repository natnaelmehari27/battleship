## How to play 

Battleships is based on the classic pen-and-paper game. you can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. 

In this version, the player first enters their name and is then asked to place a row and column to hide the player's ship from the computer. the player knows where their ships are but cannot see where the computer's ships are located. Hits are indicated by ¤.

when the player sinks all of their opponenet's battleship, the player is declared victory.
